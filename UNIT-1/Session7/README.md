# 🐍 Python Programming | Session 7: Numeric & Boolean Types

Course Context: B.Tech CSE (AI & ML Specialization) at K. R. Managalam University, Unit 1.

🔒 The Core Concept: Immutable Types
An immutable type is a fundamental Python object whose value or state cannot be changed after it has been created.

Any operation that seems to alter an immutable object actually creates a new object in memory.

Why they matter: Immutable types are important because they prevent unexpected side effects, are safe for concurrent programming, and are hashable (meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries).

#️⃣ Immutable Numeric Data Types
Python natively supports three built-in numeric data types, all of which are immutable:

Integer (int):

Represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero).

Does not have a fractional part.

Python has no limit to how long an integer value can be.

Example: 5 is an integer.

Floating-point number (float):

Represents numbers with a decimal point.

Example: 5.42 is a floating-point number.

Complex number (complex):

Represents numbers with a real part and an imaginary part (written with j).

Example: 8+2j.

✅ Boolean Type & Logic
The Boolean (bool) type is an immutable data type with only two possible values. It is essential for decision-making in Python (control flow).

Values: True or False.

Purpose: Used to represent truth values and often results from comparisons.

🚦 Logical Operators (Used for Decision-Making)
These operators are used to combine or invert boolean values:

and: Returns True if both operands are True.

or: Returns True if at least one operand is True.

not: Inverts the value (e.g., not True is False).
