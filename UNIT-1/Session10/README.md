# 📘 README: Session-10 — Python Operators

Course: Programming for Problem Solving Using Python
University: K.R. Mangalam University
Instructor: Iflah Aijaz
Session: 10
Unit: 1
Topic: Operators — Logical, Identity, Membership, Bitwise

🧠 Overview
This session introduces four key categories of Python operators used for decision-making, comparison, and low-level data manipulation:

- Logical Operators
- Identity Operators
- Membership Operators
- Bitwise Operators

🔍 Operator Summary

1. Logical Operators

Used to combine conditional statements.

- and: True if both operands are True
- or: True if at least one operand is True
- not: Inverts the Boolean value

2.Identity Operators
Used to compare memory locations of objects.

- is: True if both refer to the same object
- is not: True if they refer to different objects

3.Membership Operators
Used to check presence in sequences (lists, strings, dicts).

- in: True if value exists in sequence
- not in: True if value does not exist

4.Bitwise Operators

Used for binary-level operations on integers.

- &: AND
- |: OR
- ^: XOR
- ~: NOT
- <<: Left Shift
- >>: Right Shift
