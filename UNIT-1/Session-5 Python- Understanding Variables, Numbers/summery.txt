1# --Variable
    it is like container in memory which hold some data 
    which can be of any type. we can use like x=4
    here 4 is assigned to x it not mean that x is equal to 4
    for equal representation we use == sign .

    some rules to give name for varibles.
    1 variable names can only contain letters, numbers , underscores.
    2 Variable names can  not start with number
    3 varibles are case-sensative means (myname and MYNAME are two diifrent varibles)

    the scope of varibles is important either varible is global or local
     global means that it is available through your entire program .
     local means it is created inside a function .

     if u want make a global varible inside a function use global keyword.
     we can use it by def my_fun():
                          global my_var
                          my_var="hello world"
                          print(my_var)
