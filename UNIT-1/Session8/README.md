# Session-08 - Operators in Python

1. Session Details

- Topic: Operators — Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Precedence
2.Recap of Key Python Concepts

- Immutable Types: Numbers
  - Integer (int): Whole numbers (example: x = 42, y = -7)
  - Float (float): Decimal numbers (example: pi = 3.14159)
  - Complex (complex): Numbers with real and imaginary parts (example: z = 1 + 2j)
- Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections (example: coordinates = (10, 20))

3.Core Session Topics: Operators
A. Arithmetic Operators

- Addition (3 + 5 -> 8)
- Subtraction (7 - 2 -> 5)
- Multiplication (4 * 6 -> 24)
- Division (10 / 3 -> 3.333...)
- Floor division (10 // 3 -> 3)
- Modulus (10 % 3 -> 1)
- Exponentiation   (10**5 -> 100000)

B. Assignment Operators

- = Simple assignment (x = 10)
- += Add and assign (x += 5 is x = x + 5)
- -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **= and bitwise assignment operators (&=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=)

C. Comparison Operators

- == Equal to
- != Not equal to
- > Greater than
- < Less than
- >= Greater than or equal to
- <= Less than or equal to

4.Operator Precedence

- Parentheses: ()
- Exponentiation: ** (right-to-left)
- Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus: *, /, //, %
- Addition and Subtraction: +, -
