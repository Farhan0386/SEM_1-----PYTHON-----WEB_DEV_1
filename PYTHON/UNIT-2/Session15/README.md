# 🐍 Python Control Structures: Break and Continue – Session 15 Summary

This repository contains a Python-formatted summary of **Session 15** from the *Programming for Problem Solving Using Python* course . It focuses on control flow using `for` and `while` loops, and the use of `break` and `continue` statements.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### ✅ Looping Constructs

- **For Loop**: Iterates over sequences like lists, strings, etc.
- **While Loop**: Repeats as long as a condition is `True`.
- **Else with Loops**: Executes after the loop ends normally (not via `break`).

### 🔁 Control Statements

- **Break**: Exits the loop prematurely when a condition is met.
- **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.

## 🧪 Test Yourself Examples

Includes hands-on examples such as:

- Skipping odd/even numbers
- Breaking on specific values
- Nested loop control
- Input-based loop termination
- Searching in lists with `break`
- Skipping iterations with `continue`

---

## 🧠 Practice Questions

1. Print numbers from 1 to 50, skipping multiples of 7 using `continue`.
2. Sum even numbers from a comma-separated input, exit on non-numeric using `break`.
3. Generate random numbers until one > 7 is found, count total iterations.
