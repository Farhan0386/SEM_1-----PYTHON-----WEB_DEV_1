# 📘 README: Python Control Structures – Loops

🧠 Session Objective
This session introduces loop constructs in Python, focusing on:

- Iteration principles
- Syntax and behavior of for, while, and nested loops
- Practical applications and control flow logic

🔁 Looping in Python
What is a Loop?
Loops allow repeated execution of a block of code:

- Based on a condition (while)
- Over a sequence (for)
- Within another loop (nested)

🧮 Loop Control Tools
range() Function
Generates a sequence of numbers for controlled iteration:

- range(stop)
- range(start, stop)
- range(start, stop, step)
else with Loops
An optional else block can execute after a loop finishes normally (i.e., not interrupted by break).

🧩 Loop Applications
Loops are used for:

- Summation and counting
- Pattern generation
- Table creation
- String analysis
- Conditional filtering

🧪 Practice Prompts (No Examples)

- Iterate over a list and print each item squared.
- Use a while loop to sum all odd numbers between 1 and 50.
- Print names longer than 5 characters from a list.
- Calculate factorial using a while loop.

🔁 Recap

- for loop: Iterates over sequences.
- while loop: Executes while a condition is true.
- Nested loops: Enable multi-dimensional iteration.
- range(): Controls loop iteration count.
