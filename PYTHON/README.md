## 🎯 Course Perspective
This course introduces students to **problem-solving through Python programming** — a foundation for later courses such as **Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**.  
It focuses on understanding algorithmic logic, structured programming, and real-world data handling through Python’s core syntax, functions, and libraries.  
By the end of the course, students will be able to design, implement, debug, and document Python-based programs that solve meaningful problems.

## 📘 Detailed Syllabus

### **Unit 1: Python Foundations & Developer Workflow**
**Hours:** 15  
**Content:**
- Understanding Python’s ecosystem: CPython, Miniconda, VS Code setup  
- Interactive modes (REPL, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks)  
- Virtual environments: `venv` / `conda`  
- Version control basics with Git & GitHub  
- Variables, data types (int, float, str, bool), and basic I/O  
- Operators and precedence  
- String formatting (f-strings, slicing, escape characters)  
- Pythonic workflow: requirements.txt, project setup, environment management  

**Quick Task:**  
✅ Create a Python environment and basic script for daily automation.  
✅ Initialize a Git repo and commit initial code.

**Hours:** 13  
**Content:**
- Principles of OOP: classes, objects, methods, attributes  
- Constructors (`__init__`), inheritance, composition, encapsulation  
- Dunder methods (`__str__`, `__len__`, `__iter__`)  
- Data classes and class decorators  
- File handling (text, CSV, JSON) using `pathlib` and `open()`  
- Exception handling:
  - `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`  
  - Custom exception classes and logging  
- Packaging and modularization:
  - Creating and importing modules  
  - Folder structure and `__init__.py` usage  
- Introduction to testing frameworks: `unittest` and `pytest`  
- Continuous integration basics using GitHub Actions
