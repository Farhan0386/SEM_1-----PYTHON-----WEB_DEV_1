# 📘 README: Python Operators — Session 08

Course: Programming for Problem Solving Using Python
Institution: K.R. Mangalam University
Topic: Operators — Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Precedence

🧮 Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric data types.

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division (returns float)
- `//` : Floor Division (returns integer)
- `%` : Modulus (returns remainder)
- `**` : Exponentiation

📝 Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign and update values stored in variables.

- = : Simple assignment
- += : Add and assign
- -= : Subtract and assign
- *= : Multiply and assign
- /= : Divide and assign
- %= : Modulus and assign
- //= : Floor divide and assign
- **= : Exponentiate and assign
- &= : Bitwise AND and assign
- |= : Bitwise OR and assign
- ^= : Bitwise XOR and assign
- >>= : Bitwise right shift and assign
- <<= : Bitwise left shift and assign

🔍 Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values and return a Boolean result.

- == : Equal to
- != : Not equal to
- > : Greater than
- < : Less than
- >= : Greater than or equal to
- <= : Less than or equal to

🔢 Operator Precedence
Defines the order in which operations are evaluated in expressions.

- Parentheses ()
- Exponentiation **
- Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus * / // %
- Addition and Subtraction + -
→ Operators with the same precedence are evaluated left to right.

🧠 Key Concepts Recap

- Python numbers (int, float, complex) are immutable.
- Tuples are ordered, immutable collections.
- Strings support indexing, slicing, and concatenation.
- Arithmetic operations between different types are auto-converted.
- Division by zero raises ZeroDivisionError.
- Complex numbers support arithmetic operations.
- Parentheses can override default precedence.
- Augmented assignment simplifies repetitive operations.
