# 📘 README: Session 9 – List Comprehensions

Course: Programming for Problem Solving Using Python
University: K.R. Mangalam University

🔹 What Are List Comprehensions?
List comprehensions are a Pythonic way to create new lists using a single line of code.
They combine looping, filtering, and transformation into a compact syntax.

🔹 Why Use Them?

- Cleaner and more readable than traditional loops
- Often faster in execution
- Useful for data transformation, filtering, and mapping
- Supports arithmetic, string, and conditional logic

🔹 Syntax
[expression for item in iterable if condition]

🔹 Example
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]

Creates: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

🔹 Topics Covered

- Basic syntax
- Conditional expressions and ternary logic
- Function calls inside comprehensions
- Nested loops
- Multiple filters
- Flattening lists
- Using built-in functions
- Removing duplicates
- Combining with zip()
- Performance tips
