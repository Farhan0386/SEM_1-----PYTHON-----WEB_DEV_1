# 📘 README: Python Programming – Session 05

Topic: Variables & Numbers in Python
Course: Programming for Problem Solving Using Python
Institution: K.R. Mangalam University – School of Engineering & Technology

🧠 Session Overview
Introduction to Python variables and number types, including declaration, assignment, scope, and basic operations.

🔤 Variables in Python

- Definition: Containers for storing reusable data
- Naming Rules:
- Use letters, numbers, underscores
- Cannot start with a number
- Case-sensitive
- Conventions:
- Use lowercase
- Use underscores for clarity
- Scope:
- Local: Inside functions
- Global: Outside functions
- Use global keyword to modify global variables inside functions
- Typing:
- Python infers data types automatically
- Supports dynamic typing and typecasting

🔢 Numbers in Python

- Types:
- int: Whole numbers
- float: Decimal numbers
- Operations:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Integer division (//), modulus (%), exponentiation (**)
- Use Cases:
- Temperature conversion
- Simple interest calculation

🧪 Quick Review

- No explicit type declaration needed
- Common types: int, float, str, bool
- Type conversion: int(), float(), str()
- Comments use #
- Multiple assignment supported
