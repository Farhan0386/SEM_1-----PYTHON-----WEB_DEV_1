# 📘 Session 12: Python Control Structures – Conditionals

🧠 Overview
This session introduces the foundational logic mechanisms in Python that allow programs to make decisions and control execution flow. Control structures are essential for building dynamic, responsive, and efficient code.

🔍 Key Concepts

✅ Importance of Control Structures

- Decision Making: Enables selective execution of code blocks based on conditions.
- Repetition: Facilitates automation through loops and iterative logic.
- Flow Control: Allows skipping, breaking, or continuing execution paths using control statements.

🧩 Types of Conditional Constructs

- One-way Decision: if statement — executes code only if a condition is true.
- Two-way Decision: if-else — provides alternate execution when the condition is false.
- Hierarchical Decision: nested if — allows layered decision-making within another condition.
- Multiway Branching: if-elif-else ladder — handles multiple conditions in sequence.

🛠 Syntax Essentials

- if: Evaluates a condition and executes the block if true.
- if-else: Adds an alternate block for when the condition is false.
- Logical Operators: and, or, not — used to combine or negate conditions.
- Relational Operators: <, >, ==, !=, <=, >= — used to compare values.

🧪 Exercises Covered

- Evaluating conditions with if and if-else
- Using logical operators in decision-making
- Understanding execution flow based on condition outcomes
- Writing simple conditional programs for decision-based tasks

📌 Summary

Control structures empower Python programs to behave intelligently by making decisions and managing execution paths. Mastering these constructs is critical for writing robust, flexible, and interactive code.
